      <p>It doesn’t matter how good your software is, because if the documentation is not good enough, people will not use it. Even if for some reason they have to use it, without good documentation, they won’t use it effectively or the way you’d like them to</p>
  <p>THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE GLANCE AND LEAVE. Make it pretty so that it's easier for them to star before they leave. The more stars you have, the likelier it is that serious developers will use your repo</p>
  <p>You will be using your code in 6 months. Code that you wrote 6 months ago is often indistinguishable from code that someone else has written
  You want people to use your code because you think that others might find it useful. However, people need to understand why your code might be useful for them, before they decide to use it</p>
  <p>You want people to help out. If you don’t have documentation, you will miss out on a whole class of contributors
  You want to be a better writer</p>

      <header><h3>Best Practices</h3></header>
      <p>Keep a lighthearted friendly tone. Treat the reader as someone who doesn't have a lot of knowledge about the topic but is very interested</p>
  <p>Keep things brief
  Use headings frequently. This breaks things up when reading and often it is good for linking to specific information
  Link to other places in the documentation often but only for additional information. Readers should not have to navigate through several pages to find information regarding one specific thing. Just inline the immediately relevant information and link off if they want to know more</p>
